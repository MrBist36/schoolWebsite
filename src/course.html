          <h4>PLAYGROUP</h4>
          <P>
            Children of the ages between 18 months and 6 years are extremely receptive. RME Kids pre-schools' fun-filled programme makes the most of this by encouraging the children to understand and develop basic language skills while also developing social skills, gross and fine motor skills and creativity at the same time, through songs, music and imaginative play. At RME Kids preschools, we strongly believe that each child is a unique person and imbibes social, physical and intellectual behaviour over a period of time

          <h4>PRIMARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION</h4>
          <p>
            Access to primary education is a basic right of every child. An effective primary education can build a solid foundation and open avenues for future success. With its profound implications on both the individual and society, primary education plays a crucial role in reducing extreme poverty and promoting social changes.
            Secondary School is where kids get educated after their primary education is completed. Secondary Education acts as a link between Primary and Higher Education. The primary education is meant to educate the kids with the basics of education. Secondary Education takes place when young kids are in their adolescence therefore it is responsible for the growth and development of young children. The age of 14 to 18 years is the time when the emotional, physical and mental developments of children are at a good pace. 
            Hence we have one of the best effort to make our primary and secondary level students bright with our skilled teachers.
